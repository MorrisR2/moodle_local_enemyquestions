local/enemyquestions allows the user to mark pairs of questions as "enemy questions" -
if Question A is chosen for a quiz, don't allow Question B to also be chosen,
either manually or randomly.

Use cases include variations on essentially the same question, and
questions which might reveal the answer to another question.

For example one may wish to avoid this quiz being generated or built:

Who won the US presidential election in 1808?

Who did President Madison appoint to Secretary of State in 1809?

Why did Secretary of State Robert Smith resign in 1811?

Similarly, one may wish to avoid having multiple questions which test
essentially the same skill.

After installing this plugin, in the question bank you will see an icon
of an exclamation point within a triangle.  Clicking the icon will allow
the user to specifify which questions should not be used with the selected
question (enemy questions).
